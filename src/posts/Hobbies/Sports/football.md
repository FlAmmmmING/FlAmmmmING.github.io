“为什么热爱足球？因为它承载了我们身为平凡的普通人那不平凡的英雄梦。”<br>
Football, as the world's foremost sport, embodies the passions and dreams of countless individuals. I have a profound love for football—it's not just a sport to me, but a way of life and a source of passion. In my eyes, football is a culture, a spirit, and a force for unity. My favorite football club is Liverpool, with their passion, teamwork, and never-say-die attitude deeply captivating me. And my favorite football player is Kaoru Mitoma; his skill, intelligence, and perseverance inspire me greatly, making him my idol and role model. Football, to me, is not just a game but a belief, a way of life, and the path to my everlasting dreams.
